## General info
I was interested in learning how react native differed from vanilla react so I watched a tutorial to implement the UI. However, I extended the project by connecting to Firebase Auth API.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React
* React Native
* Firebase

## What I Learned
I really enjoyed learning the difference between React and React Native. Also going through the documentation to implement Firebase API.


	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ expo start

```
